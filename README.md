# NBA Game Predictor

**Author:** Kaeden Lee  
**Started:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** In Development

## Overview

An NBA game prediction system that analyzes historical data from multiple seasons (2020-21 through 2025-26) to predict game outcomes. The project combines web scraping, data processing, machine learning, and web deployment to create a comprehensive basketball analytics tool.

## Features

### Current Features
- **Multi-Season Data Collection**: Scrapes NBA game data from 2020-21 season to present
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Collects 30+ statistics per game including:
  - Field goal percentages (FG%, 3P%, 2P%, FT%)
  - Rebounds (offensive, defensive, total)
  - Assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, and personal fouls
  - Team and opponent scores
  - Game metadata (date, time, attendance, game length)
- **Automated Data Cleaning**: Removes duplicate headers, filters incomplete games, and standardizes formats
- **Team-Based Analysis**: Tracks all 30 NBA teams with proper team names and abbreviations

### Planned Features
- Machine learning model for game outcome prediction
- Feature engineering (rolling averages, home/away advantage, rest days)
- Web interface for real-time predictions
- Database storage (PostgreSQL)
- REST API (Spring Boot)
- Historical accuracy tracking and model evaluation

## Technologies Used

### Programming Languages
- **Python 3.7+**: Data scraping and machine learning
- **Java**: Backend API development (planned)
- **SQL**: Database management (planned)

### Python Libraries
- **Web Scraping**
  - `beautifulsoup4`: HTML parsing and data extraction
  - `requests`: HTTP requests to Basketball Reference
  - `lxml`: HTML/XML parser for pandas
- **Data Processing**
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
  - `numpy`: Numerical computing (planned)
- **Machine Learning** (planned)
  - `scikit-learn`: Model development
  - `tensorflow` or `pytorch`: Deep learning (optional)

### Frameworks & Tools (Planned)
- **Spring Boot**: Backend REST API
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing historical data and predictions
- **React** or **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend interface

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher

### macOS Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd NBA_game_predictor
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install required libraries**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install individually:
```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas lxml

```

## Usage

### Scraping Data

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the scraper
python stat_scraping/scraping.py
```

The scraper will:
1. Access Basketball Reference standings pages
2. Extract all team URLs
3. Scrape game logs and statistics for each team
4. Clean and format the data
5. Save to `nba_data_with_team_names.csv`

### Data Processing

```python
from fix_ordering import fix_game_ordering
import pandas as pd

# Load and process data
df = fix_game_ordering()

# Basic analysis
print(f"Total games: {len(df)}")
print(f"Teams: {df['Team_Name'].nunique()}")
print(f"Seasons: {df['Season'].unique()}")
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Hidden HTML Tables
**Problem:** Basketball Reference hides tables in HTML comments to prevent scraping  
**Solution:** Parse HTML comments and extract tables from commented code

### Challenge 2: Duplicate Header Rows
**Problem:** Long tables include repeated header rows for readability  
**Solution:** Filter rows where column values equal column names

### Challenge 3: Incomplete Current Season Data
**Problem:** Future games appear in tables but have no statistics  
**Solution:** Filter games where `LOG` (game length) is not null

### Challenge 4: Date Format Mismatches
**Problem:** Different date formats between game schedules and game logs  
**Solution:** Convert all dates to pandas datetime format before merging
